# OmniHilbras SDK Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Create the SDK package and normalized contracts.
  - Acceptance: strict TypeScript types exist for chat, streaming, models, capabilities, errors, and secret lookup.
  - Verify: package typecheck passes and public exports are documented by types.
  - Files: `packages/omnihilbras-sdk/package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/types.ts`, `src/errors.ts`, `src/secret-store.ts`, `src/index.ts`.
  - Scope: Small.

- [x] Task 2: Add transport, streaming, and provider registry.
  - Acceptance: fetch transport supports JSON, SSE streams, timeouts, cancellation, and normalized errors; registry resolves adapters by ID.
  - Verify: focused unit tests pass with fake fetch implementations.
  - Files: `src/transport.ts`, `src/registry.ts`, `src/streaming.ts`, tests.
  - Depends on: Task 1.
  - Scope: Medium.

- [x] Task 3: Implement the generic OpenAI-compatible adapter.
  - Acceptance: configurable base URL, auth header, model path, chat path, JSON responses, and SSE streaming normalize correctly.
  - Verify: fixture-based contract tests cover success, HTTP errors, malformed responses, and stream termination.
  - Files: `src/adapters/openai-compatible.ts`, fixtures/tests.
  - Depends on: Task 2.
  - Scope: Medium.

- [ ] Task 4: Implement the native OpenAI adapter.
  - Acceptance: bearer auth, model listing, chat completions, and `[DONE]` stream handling are isolated in the OpenAI adapter.
  - Verify: adapter tests use representative OpenAI response and stream fixtures.
  - Files: `src/adapters/openai.ts`, tests.
  - Depends on: Task 3.
  - Scope: Small/medium.

- [ ] Task 5: Implement the native Anthropic adapter.
  - Acceptance: Messages API conversion, system instructions, version headers, model listing, and native SSE event conversion are isolated in the adapter.
  - Verify: adapter tests cover text/tool responses, errors, and stream events.
  - Files: `src/adapters/anthropic.ts`, tests.
  - Depends on: Task 2.
  - Scope: Medium.

- [ ] Task 6: Implement the native Gemini adapter.
  - Acceptance: `generateContent`, model listing, authentication, request conversion, and streaming conversion are isolated in the adapter.
  - Verify: adapter tests cover candidate content, safety metadata, errors, and stream chunks.
  - Files: `src/adapters/gemini.ts`, tests.
  - Depends on: Task 2.
  - Scope: Medium.

- [ ] Task 7: Add gateway service and configuration.
  - Acceptance: local configuration loads provider credentials/endpoints through `SecretStore` and builds a provider registry without provider conditionals in the service.
  - Verify: configuration and service unit tests pass with fake adapters.
  - Files: `apps/gateway/src/config.ts`, `src/service.ts`, tests.
  - Depends on: Tasks 3–6.
  - Scope: Medium.

- [ ] Task 8: Add local HTTP routes and streaming responses.
  - Acceptance: `/health`, `/v1/models`, and `/v1/chat/completions` support JSON and SSE with consistent error envelopes.
  - Verify: integration tests use fake adapters and never contact real providers.
  - Files: `apps/gateway/src/server.ts`, routes, tests, package scripts.
  - Depends on: Task 7.
  - Scope: Medium.

- [ ] Task 9: Connect provider actions to the local gateway.
  - Acceptance: provider test/add flows call the local API and surface structured success/error states without sending preview-only fake responses.
  - Verify: browser smoke test and frontend build/typecheck pass.
  - Files: dashboard API client and provider pages.
  - Depends on: Task 8.
  - Scope: Medium.

- [ ] Task 10: Define cloud integration boundaries.
  - Acceptance: auth context, tenant context, remote `SecretStore`, and deployment configuration are represented by interfaces without implementing cloud infrastructure.
  - Verify: typecheck and architecture review.
  - Files: SDK/gateway interfaces and documentation.
  - Depends on: Task 8.
  - Scope: Small.
